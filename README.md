# Quantum Theory of Resonances
This project is a final exam project for the course "Quantum Theory of Resonances" held at Charles University in Prague, Czechia, in collaboration with the Czech Academy of Sciences in spring 2022.

The main task was implementing all the equations and algorithms derived or mentioned during lectures and solving a model problem, scattering on a predefined 1D potential, using Hermitian and Non-Hermitian approaches.
